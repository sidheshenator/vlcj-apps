# vlcj Applications #

## Important ##

This project is likely to move to github soon...

## Introduction ##

This project comprises example applications built with the [vlcj](http://code.google.com/p/vlcj) Java bindings to the [vlc](http://www.videolan.org) media player library.

The examples are intended to show the types of applications that can be built from these components and are generally more useful and 'real-world' when compared with the basic test applications included in the vlcj project.

All applications are available with complete source code.

## Minimum Requirements ##

All applications require:

  * a Java 6 (1.6) run-time environment;
  * the latest version of the [vlcj](http://code.google.com/p/vlcj/downloads/list) bindings;
  * a recent release version of vlc (at least the 1.1.x series).

Individual applications may have their own third-party class library dependencies - all such required libraries will be included in the particular application download package.

## Current Applications ##

  * [vlcj-radio](vlcjRadio.md), a rich-client internet radio player.
  * [vlcj-tube](vlcjTube.md), an integrated YouTube browser and media player.

If you use vlcj-radio, please make sure to download at least version 1.2.1 since this newer version will place much less load and bandwidth requirement on the IceCast station directory.
